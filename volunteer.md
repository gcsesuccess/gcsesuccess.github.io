# Volunteering

We're always looking for enthusiastic tutors who meet the criteria below. Our tutoring is typically carried out one-to-one, or with small groups when students outnumber tutors. Students will typically be preparing for Foundation or Higher exams in Maths, English Language and/or English Literature and will often bring their own work and questions from school.

To volunteer for GCSE Success please [enrol online](http://goo.gl/Z8hxt). You will then be contacted by a member of the Management Committee and invited to an upcoming session.

### Qualifications
Volunteers are required to have a suitable qualification in the subject(s) they wish to tutor but do not need any experience of teaching - training and [resources](resources.html) are provided, including past exam papers, mark schemes, revision guides and set texts. The existing volunteers are from diverse backgrounds, are very friendly and will offer advice and support wherever necessary.

### Commitment
An ongoing commitment is expected, with attendance of 75% of sessions encouraged. In return the scheme offers a great opportunity to gain experience of mentoring and volunteering, and a possible route into teaching. Tutors should provide reasonable notice of their availability for each session via the GCSE Success online calendar.

### Safeguarding
The scheme has a safeguarding and disclosure policy designed to protect students and tutors, which all participants must agree to. Volunteers do not work unsupervised with students.
