#### Our Big Local SW11 Summer Film Project

During August and September volunteers from GCSE Success worked with an enthusiastic group of students to produce a documentary about the local area. It was generously funded by [Big Local SW11](http://www.biglocalsw11.co.uk/) and created, filmed and presented by the students themselves. Training and editing was provided by [Keepsake Videos](http://www.keepsakevideos.co.uk/).

The project was a resounding success with the students gaining experience of working together in a team, designing and asking effective interview questions, and appearing on camera. In addition to this, over 25 members of the local community across multiple generations agreed to be interviewed by the students.

You can see the video *SW11, Our Hometown* below or on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLKUk4zNsy0). Many thanks to Big Local SW11 and everyone who took part!
