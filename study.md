# Information for Parents

We support GCSE students in year 10 or 11 living on the York Road, Kampala and Winstanley estates and attending local state schools. We aim to consistently partner students with suitable tutors, who are rigorously vetted and trained before joining the scheme. Students are encouraged to return after sitting their exams in order to mentor younger pupils.

### Quotes from our former students

> “Thank you so much, the tutoring helped massively”

> “I was pleased with my maths result which was my main focus. Thanks to your tutoring!”

> “Thank you so much … for everything! Without your help I would never have got these grades, I’m so pleased”
